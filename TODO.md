# Priority

## General

- add showProgress option for future MP
- ppm spectral averaging (Ricardo)
- FIX: MetaClean is not an optional dependency --> featureQualities()


## Features

- Normalization
    - maybe: allow usage of normalized intensities with filter()?
    - find another way to assign close/far ISTDs: if there are multiple close ones available, it makes more sense to not consider those that are a bit far away.
    - reportHTML: report normalized intensities in featInfo?
    - normInts(): default normFunc OK? and others?
        - update newProject() for any changes


## TPs

- Reporting
    - Split formulaDiff like plotGraph()?
- newProject()
    - selector for CTS transLibrary?
- plotGraph()
    - keep duplicate selector?


## MS library

- library
    - fixup annotation formulas too?
        - for now a little bit in C++ fixAnnFormula(), maybe implement verifyFormulas() in C++ someday?
    - also verify formulas of adducts?
        - would be nice in general to check for user input, but for now calculateMasses(err=FALSE) seems to suffice
    - Column name harmonization
        - More column names?
        - Make option in as.data.table() to enable/disable name harmonization?
    - sanitize input
        - MoNA: take calculated SMILES? See e.g. "PR308903" and "PR308904"
            - now prohibited since first value is always taken
            - however, for these examples the SMILES are fixed by the InChI-->SMILES conversion in prepareChemTable()
    - future
        - plotSpectrum, plotVenn, same data format for MSPeakLists
- compounds
    - show mirror spectrum in report?
        - Would need library data somehow --> perhaps compoundsLibrary can include averaged lib spectra
    - collapse with IK1?
        - yes for now, as e.g. sets and consensus expects this (UID column)
- prepareChemTable()
    - skip/warn if obabel is not available?


# Lower priority


## General

- add 'keep.rownames = FALSE' to all as.data.table methods (or see if there is a work-around)
- remove mz column from patRoonData suspects?
- convertMSFiles()
    - Agilent .d is also a directory?
    - Remove necessity to have different input/output formats? (at least OK for pwiz)
- allow specifying average function in other places where as.data.table() is used (eg clustering, plotting etc)
- delete() for other classes
- generalize makeLegend() to new plot util


## Features

- misc
    - OpenMS: alignment may yield negative RTs...
    - OpenMS MapAligner exception
        - seems to be related when little overlap between sets --> add note in doc?
- adduct annotations
    - selectIons(): prefer adducts based on MS/MS? eg handy for Na/K adducts
    - what to do with unsupported adducts for annotation?
	    - default selectIons() to only consider 'common' adducts? or change default adducts for componentization algos?
	    - check better for what is supported by SIRIUS?
- import XCMS features: verify anaInfo (or remove necessity, eg with importAnaInfo func)
- getEICsForFeatures method for kpic2?
- optimize hashing? Or further avoid hashing big objects/objects with lists?
- load OpenMS intensities in parallel
    - either with futures or with MP and cache intensities afterwards
- XCMS: multiple features grouped in same analysis?
    - can be, but now handled by default method="medret" param. Make this configurable?
- updatePICSet(): also sync peaks list? otherwise doc
- Somehow integrate XCMS::fillChromPeaks


## Annotation

- SusDat MF support
- parallel MSPeakLists generation?
- somehow handle different fragment formula annotations when making a consensus between formula/compounds objects
- DA formulas: also rank formula results like GF/SIRIUS?
- plotSpectrum/spectrumSimilarity: allow separate MSLevel for comparisons
- Support multiple MS/MS formula annotation candidates (ie same MS/MS peak annotated with different formulas)
    - mainly relevant for GenForm
    

## Components

- feature components
    - cliqueMS
        - change checkPackage GH link once PRs are merged
        - maxCharge --> chargeMax (same as OpenMS)? update docs
        - apply sort fix? https://github.com/osenan/cliqueMS/issues/8
- RC: check spearmans correlation
- NT: minimum size argument, combine rows for multiple rGroups?
- int and others: also use calculateComponentIntensities() for intensities?
- plot doesnt work for componentsReduced that originates from cluster components
    - maybe drop reduced mechanism?
- intclust
    - optionally take areas instead of intensities
    - cache results
- import check sessions?
    - needs way to match component names
    

## TPs

- predictTPsBioTransformer()
    - do we still need to check for non-calculated formulae?
- spectrumSimilarity
    - defaults OK for sim params?
        - precursor FALSE?
        - thresholds not really handy for formulas/compounds
            - at least doc that annotation results may disappear


## tests

    - server tests?
    - import
- MSPeakLists and others?: also test object that is fully empty (now still has analyses)

    - get rid of getXCMSSet() calls?
- filter()
    - document which filters work on feature level (e.g. chromWidth)
    - remove zero values for maxReplicateIntRSD?

- OpenMS: Support KD grouper?
- Integration of mzMine features (package pending...), MS-DIAL and peakonly?
- suspect screening
    - automatic suspect list name assignment if that's lacking? might be handy for some NORMAN lists

## Annotation

- MSPeakLists
    - isotope tagging is lost after averaging
    - test avg params
    - metadata() generic?
    - DA
        - generateMSPeakListsDA: find precursor masses with larger window
        - tests
            - utils? EICs with export/vdiffr?
            - test MS peak lists deisotoping?
- metadata for Bruker peaklists?
- SIRIUS: use --auto-charge instead of manually fixing charge of fragments (or not? conflicting docs on what it does)
- test score normalization?
- timeouts for SIRIUS?
- do something about negative H explained fragments by MF?
- MetFrag: auto-include suspect results if suspectListScore is selected?
- do something with sirius fingerprints? --> comparison?
- fix compoundViewer
- add new MF HD scorings and make sure default normalization equals that of MF web
- CFM-ID and MS-FINDER integration

## Suspects

- ID level rules: add scorings for SIRIUS/DA
- interface
    - also convert TASQ?
    - annotateSuspects()
        - check why it's is sometimes slow
            - seems to be logging, disable by default? --> only slow with testthat?
    - don't assign level <1 if suspect is a target? or give the choice (or make filter?)
- misc
    - prepareSuspectList(): export?
        - mainly to allow merging of lists, perhaps make util for that instead? Would also be handy for MF databases
            - could also fix column names, replace "-" with NAs etc
        - if yes, mention in ref docs for screenSuspects()
- expand reporting
    - eg include suspect name in EICs
        - already now in featInfo
    - mention suspect similarities/ranks etc for candidates (or somehow in compounds?)
    - optionally report with collapsed suspects



## components
- mass defect components
- split peak correlation and adduct etc annotation? would allow better non-target integration
- fillPeaks for CAMERA (and RAMClustR?)
- feature components
    - cliqueMS
        - current adduct conversion to this format doesn't mimic Cat and 2H/2Na etc
            - Perhaps just document limitation?
    - minimal annotation abundance across analyses (eg adduct must be annotated in >=X analyses)?
    - prefAdducts: also include eg Na by default?


## Sets
- compound/formula set consensus
    - weights for ranking (like compound consensus)?
