  abstract="Metabolites, small molecules that are involved in cellular reactions, provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually relies on tandem mass spectrometry to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These trees are found by combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the experimental data via fragmentation cascades. To obtain biochemically meaningful results requires an elaborate optimization function.",
