#' @note In most cases it will be necessary to centroid your MS input files. The only exception is \command{Bruker},
#'   however, you will still need centroided \file{mzXML}/\file{mzML} files for \emph{e.g.} plotting chromatograms. In
#'   this case the centroided MS files should be stored in the same directory as the raw \command{Bruker} \file{.d}
#'   files. The \code{\link{convertMSFiles}} function can be used to centroid data.
