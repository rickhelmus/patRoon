#' @section IMS workflows: The componentization algorithm is not aware of the IMS dimension. For this reason, no
#'   mobility feature groups will be considered for componentization, and direct IMS workflows (see
#'   \code{\link[=assignMobilities_feat]{assignMobilitities}}) are currently not supported.
