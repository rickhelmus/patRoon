#' @param setThreshold \setsWF Minimum abundance for a candidate among all sets (\samp{0-1}). For instance, a value of
#'   \samp{1} means that the candidate needs to be present in all the set data.
#' @param setThresholdAnn \setsWF As \code{setThreshold}, but only taking into account the set data that contain
#'   annotations for the feature group of the candidate.
#' @param setAvgSpecificScores \setsWF If \code{TRUE} then set specific scorings (\emph{e.g.} MS/MS match) are also
#'   averaged.
