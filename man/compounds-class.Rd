\arguments{
\item{obj, object, x, compounds}{The \code{compound} object.}

\item{i}{A numeric or character value which is used to select feature groups by
their index or name, respectively (for the order/names see \code{groupNames()}).\cr\cr For \code{[}: Can also be logical to perform logical selection
(similar to regular vectors). If missing all feature groups are selected.\cr\cr For \code{[[}: should be a scalar value.}

\item{\dots}{For \code{plotSpectrum}: Further arguments passed to
  \code{\link[graphics]{plot}}.

  Others: Any further (and unique) \code{compounds} objects.}

\item{drop, j}{ignored.}

\item{name}{The feature group name (partially matched).}

\item{fGroups}{The \code{\link{featureGroups}} object that was used to
generate this object. If not \code{NULL} it is used to add feature group
information (retention and \emph{m/z} values).}

\item{fragments}{If \code{TRUE} then information on annotated fragments will
be included.}

\item{normalizeScores}{A \code{character} that specifies how normalization of
annotation scorings occurs. Either
\code{"none"} (no normalization),
\code{"max"} (normalize to max value) or \code{"minmax"} (perform min-max
normalization). Note that normalization of negative scores (e.g. output by
\command{SIRIUS}) is always performed as min-max. Furthermore, currently
normalization for \code{compounds} takes the original min/max scoring
values into account when candidates were generated. Thus, for
\code{compounds} scoring, normalization is not affected when candidate
results were removed after they were generated (\emph{e.g.} by use of
\code{filter}).}

\item{excludeNormScores}{A
  \code{character} vector specifying any compound scoring names that
  should \emph{not} be normalized. Set to \code{NULL} to normalize all
  scorings. Note that whether any normalization occurs is set by the
  \code{excludeNormScores} argument.

  For \code{compounds}: By default \code{score} and
  \code{individualMoNAScore} are set to mimic the behavior of the
  \command{MetFrag} web interface.}

\item{minExplainedPeaks, minScore, minFragScore, minFormulaScore}{Minimum number
of explained peaks, overall score, in-silico fragmentation score and
formula score, respectively. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore. The
\code{scoreLimits} argument allows for more advanced score filtering.}

\item{scoreLimits}{Filter results by their scores. Should be a named
\code{list} that contains two-sized numeric vectors with the
minimum/maximum value of a score (use \code{-Inf}/\code{Inf} for no
limits). The names of each element should follow the values returned by
\code{\link{compoundScorings}()$name}. For instance,
\code{scoreLimits=list(numberPatents=c(10, Inf))} specifies that
\code{numberPatents} should be at least \samp{10}. For more details of
scorings see \code{\link{compoundScorings}}. Note that a result without a
specified scoring is never removed. Set to \code{NULL} to skip this filter.}

\item{elements}{Only retain candidate formulae (neutral form) that match a
given elemental restriction. The format of \code{elements} is a
\code{character} string with elements that should be present where each
element is followed by a valid amount or a range thereof. If no number is
specified then \samp{1} is assumed. For instance,
\code{elements="C1-10H2-20O0-2P"}, specifies that \samp{1-10}, \samp{2-20},
\samp{0-2} and \samp{1} carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and phosphorus atoms
should be present, respectively. When \code{length(elements)>1} formulas
are tested to follow at least one of the given elemental restrictions. For
instance, \code{elements=c("P", "S")} specifies that either one phosphorus
or one sulphur atom should be present. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore this
filter.}

\item{fragElements, lossElements}{Specifies elemental restrictions for
fragment or neutral loss formulae (charged form). Candidates are retained
if at least one of the fragment formulae follow (or not follow if
\code{negate=TRUE}) the given restrictions. See \code{elements} for the
used format.}

\item{topMost}{Only keep a maximum of \code{topMost} candidates with highest
score (or least highest if \code{negate=TRUE}). Set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{negate}{If \code{TRUE} then filters are applied in opposite manner.}

\item{formulas}{The \code{\link{formulas}} object that should be used for
scoring/annotation. For \code{plotSpectrum}: set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{updateScore}{If set to \code{TRUE} then the \code{score} column is
updated by adding the normalized \option{formulaScore} (weighted by
\option{formulaScoreWeight}). Currently, this \strong{only} makes sense for
\command{MetFrag} results!}

\item{formulaScoreWeight}{Weight used to update scoring (see
\code{updateScore} parameter).}

\item{index}{The numeric index of the candidate structure. Multiple indices
(\emph{i.e.} vector with length >=2) may be specified for
\code{plotStructure} and are mandatory for \code{getMCS}. Alternatively,
\samp{-1} may be specified to these methods to select all candidates. When
multiple indices are specified for \code{plotStructure}, their maximum
common substructure will be drawn.}

\item{groupName}{The name of the feature group to which the candidate
belongs.}

\item{width, height}{The dimensions (in pixels) of the raster image that
should be plotted.}

\item{useGGPlot2}{If \code{TRUE} then \pkg{\link{ggplot2}} is used for
plotting, otherwise base plot used. For \code{plotSpectrum}, \code{ggplot2}
allows nicely repelled text for annotation. However, base plot is generally
faster.}

\item{onlyUsed}{If \code{TRUE} then only scorings are plotted that actually
have been used to rank data (see the \code{scoreTypes} argument to
\code{\link{generateCompoundsMetFrag}} for more details).}

\item{MSPeakLists}{The \code{\link{MSPeakLists}} object that was used to
generate the candidate}

\item{onlyAnnotated}{Set to \code{TRUE} to filter out any peaks that could
not be annotated.}

\item{plotStruct}{If \code{TRUE} then the candidate structure is drawn in the
spectrum.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot. If \code{NULL} a title will be
automatically made.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{Sets the plot size limits used by
\code{\link[graphics]{plot}}. Set to \code{NULL} for automatic plot sizing.}

\item{maxMolSize}{Numeric vector of size two with the maximum width/height of
the candidate structure (relative to the plot size).}

\item{molRes}{Numeric vector of size two with the resolution of the candidate
structure (in pixels).}

\item{labels}{A \code{character} with names to use for labelling. If
\code{NULL} labels are automatically generated.}

\item{vennArgs}{A \code{list} with further arguments passed to
\pkg{VennDiagram} plotting functions. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{nsets}{See \code{\link[UpSetR]{upset}}.}

\item{nintersects}{See \code{\link[UpSetR]{upset}}.}

\item{upsetArgs}{A list with any further arguments to be passed to
\code{\link[UpSetR]{upset}}. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{absMinAbundance, relMinAbundance}{Minimum absolute or relative
(\samp{0-1}) abundance across objects for a result to be kept. For
instance, \code{relMinAbundance=0.5} means that a result should be present
in at least half of the number of compared objects. Set to \samp{NULL} to
ignore and keep all results. Limits cannot be set when \code{uniqueFrom} is
not \code{NULL}.}

\item{uniqueFrom}{Set this argument to only retain compounds that are unique
within one or more of the objects for which the consensus is made.
Selection is done by setting the value of \code{uniqueFrom} to a
\code{logical} (values are recycled), \code{numeric} (select by index) or a
\code{character} (as obtained with \code{algorithm(obj)}). For
\code{logical} and \code{numeric} values the order corresponds to the order
of the objects given for the consensus. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{uniqueOuter}{If \code{uniqueFrom} is not \code{NULL} and if
\code{uniqueOuter=TRUE}: only retain data that are also unique between
objects specified in \code{uniqueFrom}.}

\item{minMaxNormalization}{Set to \code{TRUE} to apply min-max normalization
of (merged) scoring columns. \code{FALSE} will apply normalization to the
maximum value. Scorings with negative values will always be min-max
normalized.}

\item{rankWeights}{A numeric vector with weights of to calulcate the mean
ranking score for each candidate. The value will be re-cycled if necessary,
hence, the default value of \samp{1} means equal weights for all considered
objects.}
}
\value{
\code{plotSpectrum} and \code{plotStructure} will return a
  \code{\link[=ggplot2]{ggplot object}} if \code{useGGPlot2} is \code{TRUE}.

\code{compoundTable} returns a \code{list} containing for each feature
  group a \code{\link{data.table}} with an overview of all candidate
  compounds and other data such as candidate scoring, matched MS/MS
  fragments, etc.

\code{filter} returns a filtered \code{compounds} object.

\code{addFormulaScoring} returns a \code{compounds} object updated
  with formula scoring.

\code{getMCS} returns an \CRANpkg{rcdk} molecule object
  (\code{IAtomContainer}).

\code{plotVenn} (invisibly) returns a list with the following fields: \itemize{
\item \code{gList} the \code{gList} object that was returned by
  the utilized \pkg{\link{VennDiagram}} plotting function.
\item \code{areas} The total area for each plotted group.
\item \code{intersectionCounts} The number of intersections between groups.
}

The order for the \code{areas} and \code{intersectionCounts} fields is the same as the parameter order
from the used plotting function (see \emph{e.g.} \code{\link{draw.pairwise.venn}} and
\code{\link{draw.triple.venn}}).

\code{consensus} returns a \code{compounds} object that is produced
  by merging multiple specified \code{compounds} objects.

\section{Methods (by generic)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{compoundTable}: Accessor method to obtain generated compounds.

\item \code{algorithm}: Accessor method for the algorithm (a character
string) used to generate compounds.

\item \code{groupNames}: returns a \code{character} vector with the names of the
feature groups for which data is present in this object.

\item \code{length}: Obtain total number of candidate compounds.

\item \code{show}: Show summary information for this object.

\item \code{[}: Subset on feature groups.

\item \code{[[}: Extract a compound table for a feature group.

\item \code{$}: Extract a compound table for a feature group.

\item \code{as.data.table}: Returns all MS peak list data in a table.

\item \code{identifiers}: Returns a list containing for each feature group a
character vector with database identifiers for all candidate compounds. The
list is named by feature group names, and is typically used with the
\code{identifiers} option of \code{\link{generateCompoundsMetFrag}}.

\item \code{filter}: Provides rule based filtering for generated compounds.
Useful to eliminate unlikely candidates and speed up further processing.

\item \code{addFormulaScoring}: Adds formula ranking data from a \code{\link{formulas}}
object as an extra compound candidate scoring (\code{formulaScore} column).
The formula score for each compound candidate is between \samp{0-1}, where
\emph{zero} means no match with any formula candidates, and \emph{one}
means that the compound candidate's formula is the highest ranked.

\item \code{getMCS}: Calculates the maximum common substructure (MCS)
for two or more candidate structures for a feature group. This method uses
the \code{\link{get.mcs}} function from \CRANpkg{rcdk}.

\item \code{plotStructure}: Plots a structure of a candidate compound using the
\CRANpkg{rcdk} package. If multiple candidates are specified (\emph{i.e.}
by specifying a \code{vector} for \code{index}) then the maximum common
substructure (MCS) of the selected candidates is drawn.

\item \code{plotScores}: Plots a barplot with scoring of a candidate compound.

\item \code{annotatedPeakList}: Returns an MS/MS peak list annotated with data from a
given candidate compound for a feature group.

\item \code{plotSpectrum}: Plots an annotated spectrum for a given candidate
compound for a feature group.

\item \code{plotVenn}: plots a Venn diagram (using \pkg{\link{VennDiagram}})
outlining unique and shared compound candidates of up to five different
\code{compounds} objects. Comparison is made on \code{InChIKey1}.

\item \code{plotUpSet}: plots an UpSet diagram (using the
\code{\link[UpSetR]{upset}} function) outlining unique and shared compound
candidates between different \code{compounds} objects. Comparison is made
on \code{InChIKey1}.

\item \code{consensus}: Generates a consensus of results from multiple
objects. In order to rank the consensus candidates, first
each of the candidates are scored based on their original ranking
(the scores are normalized and the highest ranked candidate gets value
\samp{1}). The (weighted) mean is then calculated for all scorings of each
candidate to derive the final ranking (if an object lacks the candidate its
score will be \samp{0}). The original rankings for each object is stored in
the \code{rank} columns.
