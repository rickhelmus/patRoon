\usage{
featureQualities(qualities = NULL)

featureGroupQualities(qualities = NULL)

featureQualityNames(feat = TRUE, group = TRUE, scores = FALSE, totScore = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{qualities}{A character vector specifying which qualities to return. If \code{NULL}, returns all available
quality definitions.}

\item{feat}{If \code{TRUE} then names specific to features are returned.}

\item{group}{If \code{TRUE} then names specific to groups are returned.}

\item{scores}{If \code{TRUE} the score names are returned, otherwise the quality names.}

\item{totScore}{If \code{TRUE} (and \code{scores=TRUE}) then the name of the total score is included.}
}
\value{
For \code{featureQualities} and \code{featureGroupQualities}: A named list containing quality definitions.
  Each element contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{func}: The MetaClean function to calculate the quality metric
\item \code{HQ}: "HV" (high values good) or "LV" (low values good)
\item \code{range}: Expected range of values (may be Inf for unbounded ranges)
}

  For \code{featureQualityNames}: A character vector with quality and/or score names.

\description{
Functions to define and work with chromatographic peak quality metrics used for feature and feature group quality
calculations.
}
\details{
These functions provide access to quality metrics that are used to assess the quality of detected features and
feature groups by the \code{\link{calculatePeakQualities}} function. The quality metrics are calculated using the
\pkg{MetaClean} package and are useful for filtering out low-quality features before further analysis.
}
\section{Feature qualities}{
 The \code{featureQualities} function defines quality metrics that are calculated for
  individual features. The following quality metrics are available:

\itemize{
\item ApexBoundaryRatio - Ratio between apex and boundary intensities
\item FWHM2Base - Full width at half maximum to base ratio
\item Jaggedness - Measure of peak smoothness
\item Modality - Measure of peak multiplicity
\item Symmetry - Measure of peak symmetry (range: -1 to 1)
\item GaussianSimilarity - Similarity to Gaussian distribution
\item Sharpness - Measure of peak sharpness
\item TPASR - Triangle peak area similarity ratio
\item ZigZag - Zig-zag index measure
}
}

\section{Feature group qualities}{
 The \code{featureGroupQualities} function defines quality metrics that are
  calculated for feature groups across multiple analyses. The following quality metrics are available:

\itemize{
\item ElutionShift - Measure of retention time consistency across analyses
\item RetentionTimeCorrelation - Correlation of retention times across analyses
}
