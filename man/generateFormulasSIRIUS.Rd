\arguments{
\item{fGroups}{\code{\link{featureGroups}} object for which formulae should be generated. This should be the same or
a subset of the object that was used to create the specified \code{MSPeakLists}. In the case of a subset only the
remaining feature groups in the subset are considered.}

\item{MSPeakLists}{An \code{\link{MSPeakLists}} object that was generated for the supplied \code{fGroups}.}

\item{relMzDev}{Maximum relative deviation between the measured and candidate formula \emph{m/z} values (in ppm).
Sets the \option{--ppm-max} command line option.}

\item{adduct}{An \code{\link{adduct}} object (or something that can be converted to it with \code{\link{as.adduct}}).
  Examples: \code{"[M-H]-"}, \code{"[M+Na]+"}. If the \code{featureGroups} object has
  adduct annotations then these are used if \code{adducts=NULL}.

  \setsWF The \code{adduct} argument is not supported for sets workflows, since the
  adduct annotations will then always be used.}

\item{projectPath, dryRun}{These are mainly for internal purposes. \code{projectPath} sets the output directory for
the \command{SIRIUS} output (a temporary directory if \code{NULL}). If \code{dryRun} is \code{TRUE} then no
computations are done and only the results from \code{projectPath} are processed.

\setsWF \code{projectPath} should be a \code{character} specifying the paths for each set.}

\item{elements}{Elements to be considered for formulae calculation. This will heavily affects the number of
candidates! Always try to work with a minimal set by excluding elements you don't expect. The minimum/maximum
number of elements can also be specified, for example: a value of \code{"C[5]H[10-15]O"} will only consider
formulae with up to five carbon atoms, between ten and fifteen hydrogen atoms and any amount of oxygen atoms. Sets
the \option{--elements} command line  option.}

\item{profile}{Name of the configuration profile, for example: \option{"qtof"}, \option{"orbitrap"},
\option{"fticr"}. Sets the \option{--profile} commandline option.}

\item{database}{If not \code{NULL}, use a database for retrieval of formula
candidates. Possible values are: \option{"pubchem"}, \option{"bio"}, \option{"kegg"}, \option{"hmdb"}. Sets the
\option{--database} commandline option.}

\item{noise}{Median intensity of the noise (\code{NULL} ignores this parameter). Sets the \option{--noise}
commandline option.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores \command{SIRIUS} will use. If \code{NULL} then the default of all cores will be
used.}

\item{topMost}{Only keep this number of candidates (per feature group) with highest
score. Sets the \option{--candidates} command line option.}

\item{extraOptsGeneral, extraOptsFormula}{a \code{character} vector with any extra commandline parameters for
\command{SIRIUS}. For \command{SIRIUS} versions \code{<4.4} there is no distinction between general and formula
options. Otherwise commandline options specified in \code{extraOptsGeneral} are added prior to the \code{formula}
command, while options specified in \code{extraOptsFormula} are added in afterwards. See the \command{SIRIUS}
manual for more details. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore.}

\item{calculateFeatures}{If \code{TRUE} fomulae are first calculated for all features
prior to feature group assignment (see \verb{Candidate assignment} in \code{\link{generateFormulas}}).}

\item{featThreshold}{If \code{calculateFeatures=TRUE}: minimum presence (\samp{0-1}) of a formula in all features
before it is considered as a candidate for a feature group. For instance, \code{featThreshold=0.75} dictates that a
formula should be present in at least 75\% of the features inside a feature group.}

\item{featThresholdAnn}{As \code{featThreshold}, but only considers features with annotations. For instance,
\code{featThresholdAnn=0.75} dictates that a formula should be present in at least 75\% of the features with
annotations inside a feature group. @param topMost Only keep this number of candidates
(per feature group) with highest score. Sets the \option{--candidates} command line
option.}

\item{absAlignMzDev}{When the group formula annotation consensus is made from feature annotations, the \emph{m/z}
values of annotated MS/MS fragments may slightly deviate from those of the corresponding group MS/MS peak list. The
\code{absAlignMzDev} argument specifies the maximum \emph{m/z} window used to re-align the mass peaks.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} then more output is shown in the terminal.}

\item{splitBatches}{If \code{TRUE} then the calculations done by \command{SIRIUS} will be evenly split over multiple
\command{SIRIUS} calls (which may be run in parallel depending on the \link[=patRoon-package]{set package
options}). If \code{splitBatches=FALSE} then all feature calculations are performed from a single \command{SIRIUS}
execution, which is often the fastest if calculations are performed on a single computer.}

\item{\dots}{\setsWF Further arguments passed to the non-sets workflow method.}

\item{setThreshold}{\setsWF Minimum abundance for a candidate among all sets (\samp{0-1}). For instance, a value of
\samp{1} means that the candidate needs to be present in all the set data.}

\item{setThresholdAnn}{\setsWF As \code{setThreshold}, but only taking into account the set data that contain
annotations for the feature group of the candidate.}

\item{setAvgSpecificScores}{\setsWF If \code{TRUE} then set specific scorings (\emph{e.g.} MS/MS match) are also
averaged.}

\value{
A \code{\link{formulas}} object containing all generated formulae.
}
\description{
Uses \href{https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/}{SIRIUS} to generate chemical formulae candidates.
}
\details{
This function uses sirius to generate formula candidates. This function is called when calling \code{generateFormulas} with
  \code{algorithm="sirius"}.

Similarity of measured and theoretical isotopic patterns will be used for scoring candidates. Note that
  \command{SIRIUS} requires availability of MS/MS data.
}
\note{
For annotations performed with \command{SIRIUS} it is often the fastest to keep the default
  \code{splitBatches=FALSE}. In this case, all \command{SIRIUS} output will be printed to the terminal (unless
  \code{verbose=FALSE} or \option{patRoon.MP.method="future"}). Furthermore, please note that only annotations to be
  performed for the same adduct are grouped in a single batch execution.
}
\section{Parallelization}{
 generateFormulasSIRIUS uses multiprocessing to parallelize
  computations. Please see the parallelization section in the handbook for
  more details and \link[=patRoon-package]{patRoon options} for configuration
  options.
