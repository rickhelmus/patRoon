\usage{
generateTPsLibrary(
  parents = NULL,
  TPLibrary = NULL,
  generations = 1,
  skipInvalid = TRUE,
  prefCalcChemProps = TRUE,
  matchParentsBy = "InChIKey",
  matchGenerationsBy = "InChIKey",
  calcSims = FALSE,
  fpType = "extended",
  fpSimMethod = "tanimoto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parents}{The parents for which transformation products should be obtained. This can be (1) a suspect list (see
\link[=suspect-screening]{suspect screening} for more information), (2) the resulting output of
\code{\link{screenSuspects}} or (3) a \code{\link{compounds}} annotation object. In the former two cases, the
suspect (hits) are used as parents, whereas in the latter case all candidates are used as parents.
If \code{NULL} then TPs for all parents in the library are obtained.}

\item{TPLibrary}{If \code{NULL}, a default \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5644560}{PubChem} based library is
used. Otherwise, \code{TPLibrary} should be a \code{data.frame}. See the details below.}

\item{generations}{An \code{integer} that specifies the number of transformation generations. TPs for subsequent
iterations obtained by repeating the library search where the TPs from the previous generation are considered
parents.}

\item{skipInvalid}{If set to \code{TRUE} then the parents will be skipped (with a warning) for which insufficient
information (\emph{e.g.} SMILES) is available.}

\item{prefCalcChemProps}{If \code{TRUE} then calculated chemical properties such as the formula and
\acronym{InChIKey} are preferred over what is already present in the parent suspect list. For efficiency reasons it is
recommended to set this to \code{TRUE}. See the \verb{Validating and calculating chemical properties} section for
more details.}

\item{matchParentsBy}{A \code{character} that specifies how the input parents are matched with the data from the TP
library. Valid options are: \code{"InChIKey"}, \code{"InChIKey1"}, \code{"InChI"}, \code{"SMILES"},
\code{"formula"}, \code{"name"}. If the parent from the TP library is matched with multiple input parents then only
the first is considered.}

\item{matchGenerationsBy}{Similar to \code{matchParentsBy}, but specifies how parents/TPs are matched when
\code{generations>1}.}

\item{calcSims}{If set to \code{TRUE} then structural similarities between the parent and its TPs are calculated. A
minimum similarity can be obtained by using the \link[=filter,transformationProductsStructure-method]{filter
method}. May be useful under the assumption that parents and TPs who have a high structural similarity, also likely
have a high MS/MS spectral similarity (which can be evaluated after componentization with
\code{\link{generateComponentsTPs}}).}

\item{fpType}{The type of structural fingerprint that should be calculated. See the \code{type} argument of the
\code{\link{get.fingerprint}} function of \CRANpkg{rcdk}.}

\item{fpSimMethod}{The method for calculating similarities (i.e. not dissimilarity!). See the \code{method} argument
of the \code{\link{fp.sim.matrix}} function of the \CRANpkg{fingerprint} package.}
}
\value{
The TPs are stored in an object derived from the \code{\link{transformationProductsStructure}} class.
}
\description{
Automatically obtains transformation products from a library.
}
\details{
This function uses a library to obtain transformation products. This function is called when calling \code{generateTPs} with
  \code{algorithm="library"}.

By default, a library is used that is based on data from
  \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5644560}{PubChem}. However, it also possible to use your own library.

An important advantage of this algorithm is that it provides structural information for generated TPs.
  However, this also means that if the input is from a parent suspect list or screening then either \acronym{SMILES}
  or \acronym{InChI} information must be available for the parents.
}
\note{
When the \code{parents} argument is a \code{\link{compounds}} object, the candidate library \code{identifier}
  is used in case the candidate has no defined \code{compoundName}.
}
\section{TP libraries}{
 The \code{TPLibrary} argument is used to specify a custom TP library. This should be a
  \code{data.frame} where each row specifies a TP for a parent, with the following columns: \itemize{

  \item \code{parent_name} and \code{TP_name}: The name of the parent/TP.

  \item \code{parent_SMILES} and \code{TP_SMILES} The SMILES of the parent/TP structure.

  \item \code{retDir} The retention direction of the TP compared to its parent: \samp{-1} (elutes before), \samp{1}
  (elutes after) or \samp{0} (elutes similarly or unknown). If not specified then the \code{log P} values below may
  be used to calculate retention time directions. (\strong{optional})

  \item \code{parent_LogP} and \code{TP_LogP} The \code{log P} values for the parent/TP. (\strong{optional})

  \item \code{LogPDiff} The difference between parent and TP \code{Log P} values. Ignored if \emph{both}
  \code{parent_LogP} and \code{TP_LogP} are specified. (\strong{optional})

  }

  Other columns are allowed, and will be included in the final object. Multiple TPs for a single parent are specified
  by repeating the value within \code{parent_} columns.
}

\section{Validating and calculating chemical properties}{
 Chemical properties such as \acronym{SMILES},
  \acronym{InChIKey} and formula in the parent suspect list are automatically validated and calculated if missing/invalid.

  The internal validation/calculation process performs the following steps: \itemize{

  \item Validation of \acronym{SMILES}, \acronym{InChI}, \acronym{InChIKey} and formula data (if present). Invalid
  entries will be set to \code{NA}.

  \item The \acronym{SMILES} and \acronym{InChI} data are used to calculate missing or invalid \acronym{SMILES},
  \acronym{InChI}, \acronym{InChIKey} and formula data. If \code{prefCalcChemProps=TRUE} then existing
  \acronym{InChIKey} and formula data is overwritten by calculated values whenever possible.

  \item The chemical formulae which were \emph{not} calculated are verified and normalized. This process may be time
  consuming, and is potentially largely avoided by setting \code{prefCalcChemProps=TRUE}.

  \item Neutral masses are calculated for missing values (\code{prefCalcChemProps=FALSE}) or whenever possible
  (\code{prefCalcChemProps=TRUE}).

  }

  Note that calculation of formulae for molecules that are isotopically labelled is currently only supported for
  deuterium (2H) elements.

  This functionality relies heavily on \href{http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page}{OpenBabel}, please make sure it is
  installed.
