\usage{
generateTPsLibraryFormula(
  parents = NULL,
  TPLibrary,
  generations = 1,
  skipInvalid = TRUE,
  prefCalcChemProps = TRUE,
  matchParentsBy = "name",
  matchGenerationsBy = "name"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parents}{The parents for which transformation products should be obtained. This should be either a suspect list
(see \link[=suspect-screening]{suspect screening} for more information) or the resulting output of
\code{\link{screenSuspects}}. The suspect (hits) are used as parents. If \code{NULL} then TPs for all parents in
the library are obtained.}

\item{TPLibrary}{A \code{data.frame}. See the details below.}

\item{generations}{An \code{integer} that specifies the number of transformation generations. TPs for subsequent
iterations obtained by repeating the library search where the TPs from the previous generation are considered
parents.}

\item{skipInvalid}{If set to \code{TRUE} then the parents will be skipped (with a warning) for which insufficient
information (\emph{e.g.} SMILES) is available.}

\item{prefCalcChemProps}{If \code{TRUE} then calculated chemical properties such as the formula and
\acronym{InChIKey} are preferred over what is already present in the parent suspect list. For efficiency reasons it is
recommended to set this to \code{TRUE}. See the \verb{Validating and calculating chemical properties} section for
more details.}

\item{matchParentsBy}{A \code{character} that specifies how the input parents are matched with the data from the TP
library. Valid options are: \code{"InChIKey"}, \code{"InChIKey1"}, \code{"InChI"}, \code{"SMILES"},
\code{"formula"}, \code{"name"}. If the parent from the TP library is matched with multiple input parents then only
the first is considered.}

\item{matchGenerationsBy}{Similar to \code{matchParentsBy}, but specifies how parents/TPs are matched when
\code{generations>1}.}
}
\value{
The TPs are stored in an object derived from the \code{\link{transformationProductsFormula}} class.
}
\description{
Automatically obtains transformation products from a library with formula data.
}
\details{
This function uses a library to obtain transformation products. This function is called when calling \code{generateTPs} with
  \code{algorithm="library_formula"}.

This function is similar to \code{\link{generateTPsLibrary}}, however, it only require formula information
  of the parent and TPs.
}
\note{
Unlike \code{\link{generateTPsLibrary}}, this function defaults the \code{matchParentsBy} and
  \code{matchGenerationsBy} arguments to \code{"name"}. While matching by \code{formula} is also possible, it is
  likely that duplicate parent formulae (\emph{i.e.} isomers) are present in \code{parents} and/or \code{TPLibrary},
  making matching by formula unsuitable. However, if you are sure that no duplicate formulae are present, it may be
  better to set the matching method to \code{"formula"}.
}
\section{TP libraries}{
 The \code{TPLibrary} argument is used to specify a custom TP library. This should be a
  \code{data.frame} where each row specifies a TP for a parent, with the following columns: \itemize{

  \item \code{parent_name} and \code{TP_name}: The name of the parent/TP.

  \item \code{parent_formula} and \code{TP_formula} The formula of the parent/TP structure.

  \item \code{retDir} The retention direction of the TP compared to its parent: \samp{-1} (elutes before), \samp{1}
  (elutes after) or \samp{0} (elutes similarly or unknown). If not specified then the \code{log P} values below may
  be used to calculate retention time directions. (\strong{optional})

  \item \code{parent_LogP} and \code{TP_LogP} The \code{log P} values for the parent/TP. (\strong{optional})

  \item \code{LogPDiff} The difference between parent and TP \code{Log P} values. Ignored if \emph{both}
  \code{parent_LogP} and \code{TP_LogP} are specified. (\strong{optional})

  }

  Other columns are allowed, and will be included in the final object. Multiple TPs for a single parent are specified
  by repeating the value within \code{parent_} columns.
}

\section{Validating and calculating chemical properties}{
 Chemical properties such as \acronym{SMILES},
  \acronym{InChIKey} and formula in the parent suspect list are automatically validated and calculated if missing/invalid.

  The internal validation/calculation process performs the following steps: \itemize{

  \item Validation of \acronym{SMILES}, \acronym{InChI}, \acronym{InChIKey} and formula data (if present). Invalid
  entries will be set to \code{NA}.

  \item The \acronym{SMILES} and \acronym{InChI} data are used to calculate missing or invalid \acronym{SMILES},
  \acronym{InChI}, \acronym{InChIKey} and formula data. If \code{prefCalcChemProps=TRUE} then existing
  \acronym{InChIKey} and formula data is overwritten by calculated values whenever possible.

  \item The chemical formulae which were \emph{not} calculated are verified and normalized. This process may be time
  consuming, and is potentially largely avoided by setting \code{prefCalcChemProps=TRUE}.

  \item Neutral masses are calculated for missing values (\code{prefCalcChemProps=FALSE}) or whenever possible
  (\code{prefCalcChemProps=TRUE}).

  }

  Note that calculation of formulae for molecules that are isotopically labelled is currently only supported for
  deuterium (2H) elements.

  This functionality relies heavily on \href{http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page}{OpenBabel}, please make sure it is
  installed.
