# Summary

Non-target analysis (NTA) via chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is used to monitor and
identify organic chemicals in the environment. Biotic and abiotic processes can transform original chemicals (parents)
into _transformation products_ (TPs). These TPs can be of equal or more concern than their parent compounds and are
therefore critical to monitor and identify in the environment [@Farre2008;@Escher2011], often with NTA. 
Given the amount of data generated by NTA, advanced automated data processing workflows are essential. The open-source,
`R`-based [@R] platform `patRoon` [@Helmus2021] offers automated, straightforward, flexible and comprehensive NTA
workflows.

This article describes improvements introduced in `patRoon 2.0`, including extensive TP screening and simultaneous
processing of positive and negative HRMS data. The updated documentation and code are available via
<https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon> and archived in @patRoon20Zen.

# Statement of need

The identification of chemicals in NTA still remains a grand challenge [@Vermeulen2020]; only a small percentage of
detected masses can be confidently annotated with spectral libraries [@daSilva2015]. The unidentified "dark matter" is
partly due to TPs, motivating the need for TP screening workflows. Reported approaches to elucidate TPs in the
environment include screening of known/predicted TPs, parent/TP classification techniques, isotope labeling experiments
and identifying expected (dis)similarities in MS data (shown in \autoref{tab:TPApproaches}; also reviewed in @Li2021).
However, these approaches are typically designed for a single study or available only as a stand-alone and/or commercial
tool. Furthermore, few TP prediction tools support specific pathways observed in the environment (e.g., microbial
degradation), are open-source and can be readily integrated in workflows for automated batch predictions. `patRoon 2.0`
implements complementary TP screening approaches with select algorithms from \autoref{tab:TPApproaches} and includes
other novel functionality to provide comprehensive TP screening workflows. The modular design of `patRoon`
enables integration of more approaches and algorithms in the future.

Since wide chemical coverage is desired with NTA and since TPs can ionize differently to their parent, HRMS analyses
are often performed using positive and negative ionization mode. `patRoon 2.0` is now capable of simultaneously
processing, integrating and interpreting mixed mode data - a functionality not available in most workflows due to
complexity and long processing times.

Further improvements to `patRoon` include interactive data curation and new prioritization and identification
strategies, described further below.


# New functionality

## Transformation product screening workflow

The `patRoon 2.0` TP screening workflow starts with features (data points with unique chromatographic/MS information)
obtained from a 'classical' `patRoon` workflow (\autoref{fig:TPworkflow}A). Then, data from one or more of TP screening
(B,C), MS similarity (D) and parent/TP feature classification (E) is combined to link parent and TP features into
components (F). The resulting data is then prioritized (G), corresponding features are annotated (H), and finally all
data is reported (I). All algorithm parameters are configurable, yet simplified via defaults. This enables flexible and
customizable workflows for a wide variety of applications.

TP screening uses known/predicted TP structures from parents (\autoref{fig:TPworkflow}B) or mass differences of
transformations using metabolic logic [@Scholle2015] (C). Parents for (B) are specified from (1) a target list, (2)
results of a _suspect screening_ to find parents by mass, or (3) candidates of feature compound annotation (see
@Helmus2021). Corresponding TP structures are then either obtained _in silico_ with [BioTransformer]
[@DjoumbouFeunang2019], or through a library search from PubChem data [@Kim2021;@Schymanski2021;@Krier2022;@PubChemTPs]
or a custom-made library. Metabolic logic (C), which does not depend on parent structural data, uses transformation
reactions from @Scholle2015 or a custom-made list. TP suspect screening then matches candidate TPs with detected
features by mass.

MS similarity (\autoref{fig:TPworkflow}D) is calculated, without a predefined parent list, from spectral match and/or
equivalence of spectral annotations. Spectral match compares MS fragment spectra (MS/MS) with a cosine or Jaccard index
similarity score [@Stein1994]. This was largely implemented in `C++` to allow efficient comparison of large numbers of
spectra (typically thousands). The calculation can be adjusted by (1) pre-treatment of spectra, e.g., with peak count and
intensity thresholds, (2) weight assignment to intensity and _m/z_ data, and (3) shifting TP spectra to highlight equal
neutral losses [@Watrous2012;@Scholle2017]. Furthermore, combining matched mass peaks from shifted and non-shifted
spectra was implemented for similarity calculation of equivalent fragments _and_ neutral losses. MS similarity from
annotation equivalence compares formulas of annotated MS/MS fragments and neutral losses, based on additional data such
as isotopic fit and spectral libraries. This potentially increases accuracy, but requires presence of annotations for
parent/TP features.

Parent/TP feature classification (\autoref{fig:TPworkflow}E) is typically performed by statistical analyses with `R`,
facilitated by the `patRoon` data export functionality. Fold-change calculation and visualization with volcano plots
[@Cui2003] was implemented in `patRoon 2.0` to simplify the usage of this common classification technique.


![TP screening workflow in `patRoon 2.0`. One or more of steps B/C, D and E are used to generate TP components by
linking and grouping parent/TP features (F). The TP annotation (H) can be enriched with data from (B).
\label{fig:TPworkflow}](TP_workflow.png)


During TP componentization (\autoref{fig:TPworkflow}F), each parent feature is linked with corresponding TP features and
grouped in a TP component. Data prioritization (G) can then be performed with the subsetting functionality of `patRoon`
and several newly implemented filters (\autoref{tab:TPFilters}). Existing [MetFrag] [@Ruttkies2016] annotation
functionality was extended to include predicted TP structures (B) to allow _in silico_ MS/MS annotation (H) of TPs
absent from commonly used databases. The interactive reporting (I) functionality was extended to simplify inspection of
TP screening results (see \autoref{fig:TPreport}).

## Sets workflows: combining positive and negative MS ionization data

In a _sets workflow_, positive and negative data is automatically processed and combined (\autoref{fig:sets_idl}A).
Features are obtained for each polarity, and optionally prioritized with polarity specific conditions (e.g., minimum
intensity). Then, the feature _m/z_ values are replaced with neutral masses calculated from adduct information (defined
manually or via feature adduct annotations), and subsequently aligned and grouped across polarities (with configurable
tolerances). Subsequent steps largely follow the `patRoon 1.0` workflow [@Helmus2021]. Algorithms incapable of
processing polarity mixed data are automatically executed with polarity specific data, and outputs are subsequently
combined. Moreover, a consensus for formula/compound annotations can be reached, for instance, to eliminate candidates
not found for both polarities.

Sets workflows follow a generic design, where each _set_ is a group of analyses that demand independent processing of
MS related data (features, mass spectra etc). Therefore, sets can also be differentiated by other MS parameters such as
MS/MS fragmentation technique or ionization source. Furthermore, the design allows future implementation of workflows
with different chromatographic methods, for instance, to simultaneously process data from different instruments.


![**A**  Sets workflow with simultaneous processing of positive and negative data. Alignment of positive/negative
features can be improved with adduct annotations. The workflow continues identically to the `patRoon 1.0` workflow, and
positive/negative data is automatically processed separately for algorithms without mixed polarity support. **B**

# Example workflows

## Simultaneous processing of positive/negative data

Performing a sets workflow is straightforward, and requires only few additions to a `patRoon 1.0` workflow.

```r
# Load patRoon and patRoonData libraries.
library(patRoon)
library(patRoonData)

# Obtain features for positive/negative data
fListPos <- findFeatures(exampleAnalysisInfo("positive"), "openms")
fListNeg <- findFeatures(exampleAnalysisInfo("negative"), "openms")

# Initiate sets workflow with default (de-)protonated adducts
fListSet <- makeSet(fListPos, fListNeg, adducts = c("[M+H]+", "[M-H]-"))

# Neutralize features and group across analyses and sets
fGroups <- groupFeatures(fListSet, "openms")

# Perform prioritization, annotation, reporting etc as a 'classical' workflow
...
```

## TP screening

The code below demonstrates a simple TP screening workflow where (1) parents are screened, (2) corresponding TPs are
predicted with `BioTransformer`, (3) the TPs are screened, (4) TP components are generated and (5) all results are
reported.

```r
# (1) Screen parents
parentSuspects <- data.frame(name = c("Carbamazepine", "Benzotriazole"),
                             SMILES = c("C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C=CC3=CC=CC=C3N2C(=O)N",
                                        "C1=CC2=NNN=C2C=C1"))
fGroupsScr <- screenSuspects(fGroups, parentSuspects, adduct = "[M+H]+")

# (2) Predict TPs with BioTransformer
TPs <- generateTPs("biotransformer", parents = fGroupsScr)

# (3) Screen for the TPs and amend previous results
TPSuspects <- convertToSuspects(TPs)
fGroupsScr <- screenSuspects(fGroupsScr, TPSuspects, adduct = "[M+H]+",
                             amend = TRUE)
fGroupsScr <- filter(fGroupsScr, onlyHits = TRUE)

# (4) Generate the TP components
componentsTP <- generateComponents(fGroupsScr, "tp", TPs = TPs)

# (5) Generate interactive HTML report
reportHTML(fGroupsScr, components = componentsTP)
```

The code for these and more advanced workflows are easily generated with the `newProject()` function. The
[Handbook] outlines more examples of typical TP screening workflows.
